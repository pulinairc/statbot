Setup:
======

 Follow the examples below. It is possible to define values in either the
  default variable or within the individual rss feed variables. You can define

  default ones.

                     0 = Message Channel

                   Default: 30

 Optional:
 ---------
  trigger          Public trigger to list feeds. (if you only want to define it
                    once in default use @@feedid@@, this will be replaced by
                    each individual feeds id)

  evaluate-tcl     Evaluate the output before sending it to channel.
                   Default: 0 (Off)

  enable-gzip      Enable gzip decompression for this feed.
                   Default: 0 (Off)

  remove-empty     Remove empty cookies from the output.
                   Default: 1 (On)

  output-order     The order you want the articles to be announced in channel.
                   Options:
                    0 = Ascending (Oldest -> Newest)
                    1 = Descending (Newest -> Oldest)

  charset          This is the charset you want the feed to be outputted using.
                    The default charset is what your local system charset is set
                    to use. In most cases, if you're having problems with output
                    just use utf-8.
                   Example: utf-8
                            cp1251
                            iso8859-1

Cookies:
========

  Output works on a cookie system, in this case its dynamic so it depends on
   what data the feed contains as to what you can output.

  As of version 0.3 you are able to reference any tag within each article, or
   if you really want the whole feed. The format is @@<tag>!<subtag>!...@@,
   @@item@@ and @@entry@@ cookies are 'shortcuts' and will always point to the
   current article. If you wish to output an attribute of a tag you can do that
   by using the attribute name with an = in front of it
   (eg: @@entry!link!=href@@). This would get the 'href' attribute from the
   <link> tag. Refer to rss-synd.tcl for more examples.

Dependencies:
=============

 This script will run perfectly fine without any of these dependencies, but
  if you want any of these features you'll need to download and install the
  respective package(s).
