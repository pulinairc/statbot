#
# This is a sample configuration file for your bot.  You will definitely
# want to edit this, to set up your bot.  Right now it creates a bot called
# "LamestBot" which sits on channel #lamest.
#
# PLEASE EDIT THIS FILE COMPLETELY! YOUR BOT WILL NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY IF
# YOU DO NOT CONFIGURE IT CORRECTLY! WE CAN NOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH!
#
# NOTE: Please choose your +n (owner) users carefully! They have COMPLETE
# access to your bot *AND* account! Only pick ones you trust!
#
#
# more options can be found in files in doc/settings/

##### GENERAL STUFF #####

# the username the bot uses, this is only used if identd isn't working
# on the machine the bot is running on.
set username "kummitus"

# who's running this bot?
set admin "rolle"

# what IRC network are you on?  this is just info to share with others on
# your botnet, for human curiosity only.
set network "xs4all.nl.quakenet.org"

# what timezone is your bot in?  The timezone string specifies the name of
# the timezone and must be three or more alphabetic characters.
#
# ex. Central European Time(UTC+1) would be "CET"
set timezone "GMT"

# offset specifies the time value to be added to the local time to get
# Coordinated Universal Time (UTC aka GMT).  The offset is positive if the
# local timezone is west of the Prime Meridian and negative if it is east.
# The value(hours) must be between 0 and 24.
#
# ex. if the timezone is UTC+1 the offset is -1
set offset "2"

# If you dont want to use the timezone setting for scripting purpose
# only but instead everywhere possible (new) then uncomment the next line.
#set env(TZ) "$timezone $offset"

# if you're using virtual hosting (your machine has more than 1 IP), you
# may want to specify the particular IP to bind to.  you can specify
# either by hostname or by IP.  you may also want to set the hostname
# here if eggdrop has trouble detecting it when it starts up.  (it will
# let you know if it has trouble -- trust me.)
#set my-hostname "virtual.host.com"
#set my-ip "99.99.0.0"

# if you want to have your eggdrop messages displayed in another language
# change the below command to match your preferences. An alternative would
# be to set the environment variable EGG_LANG to that value.
addlang "finnish"


##### LOG FILES #####

# You can specify a limit on how many log files you can have.
# At midnight every day, the old log files are renamed and a new log file begins.
# By default, the old one is called "(logfilename).yesterday",
# and any logfiles before yesterday are erased.

# Events are logged by certain categories -- this way you can specify
# exactly what kind of events you want sent to various logfiles.  the
# events are:
#   m  private msgs/ctcps to the bot
#   k  kicks, bans, mode changes on the channel
#   j  joins, parts, netsplits on the channel
#   p  public chatter on the channel
#   s  server connects/disconnects/notices
#   b  information about bot linking and userfile sharing
#   c  commands people use (via msg or dcc)
#   x  file transfers and file-area commands
#   r  (if use-console-r defined) EVERYTHING sent to the bot by the server
#   o  other: misc info, errors -- IMPORTANT STUFF
#   w  wallops: msgs between IRCops (be sure to set the bot +w in init-server)
# There are others, but you probably shouldn't log them, it'd be rather
# unethical ;)

# maximum number of logfiles to allow - this can be increased if needed
# (don't decrease this)
set max-logs 10

# maximum size of your logfiles, set this to 0 to disable.
# this only works if you have keep-all-logs 0 (OFF)
# this value is in KiloBytes, so '550' would mean cycle logs when
# it reaches the size of 550 KiloBytes.
set max-logsize 0

# write the logfiles and check the size every minute
# (if max-logsize is enabled) instead of every 5minutes as before.
# This could be good if you have had problem with the
# logfile filling your quota or hdd or if you log +p
# and publish it on the web and wants more uptodate info.
# If you are concerned with resources keep the default setting 0.
# (although I haven't noticed anything)
set quick-logs 0

# each logfile also belongs to a certain channel.  events of type 'k', 'j',
# and 'p' are logged to whatever channel they happened on.  most other
# events are currently logged to every channel.  you can make a logfile
# belong to all channels by assigning it to channel "*".  there are also
# five user-defined levels ('1'..'5') which are used by Tcl scripts.

# in 'eggdrop.log' put private msgs/ctcps, commands, misc info, and
# errors from any channel:
#logfile mco * "logs/eggdrop.log"
logfile mbcxow * "logs/moxquizz.log"
logfile 1c * "logs/quizz.log"
# in 'lame.log' put joins, parts, kicks, bans, and mode changes from #lamest:
#logfile jk #lamest "logs/lamest.log"

# [0/1] timestamp entries in the log file? (generally a good idea)
set log-time 1

# [0/1] keep logfiles for more than 48 hours -- instead of being called
# "(logfilename).yesterday", the log files are named by the current date,
# and kept around forever (eventually your directory might get full, so
# be careful with this!)
set keep-all-logs 1

# if keep-all-logs is 1, this setting will define the suffix of the logfiles.
# The default will result in a suffix like "04May2000". "%Y%m%d" will produce
# the often used yyyymmdd format. Read the strtime manpages for more options.
# NOTE: On systems which don't support strftime, the default format will
# be used _always_.
set logfile-suffix ".%d%b%Y"

# once a day the logfiles are switched out and started fresh --
# this specifies when that should happen (in military time)
# [note that a leading 0 will make Tcl think this is an octal value,
# something you probably don't want.]
set switch-logfiles-at 300

# [0/1] enable quiet saves? "Writing user file..." and "Writing channel file ..."
# will not be logged if this option is enabled.
set quiet-save 0

# this is the default console mode -- what masters will see automatically
# when they dcc chat with the bot (masters can alter their own console
# flags once they connect, though) -- it uses the same event flags as
# the log files
# (note that the console channel is automatically set to your "primary"
# channel -- the one you defined first in this file.  masters can change
# their console channel with the '.console' command, however.)
set console "mkjpbswcox"


##### FILES AND DIRECTORIES #####

# the userfile: where user records are stored
set userfile "QuizBot.user"

# [0/1] do you want the userlist to be sorted when saving
set sort-users 0

# where the help files can be found (and there are plenty)
set help-path "help/"

# a good place to temporarily store files (i.e.: /tmp)
set temp-path "/tmp"

# the MOTD is displayed when people dcc chat to the bot.
# type '.help set motd' in DCC CHAT for tons of motd options.
set motd "text/motd"

# holds the banner displayed on telnet connections
set telnet-banner "text/banner"

##### BOTNET #####

# you probably shouldn't deal with this until reading 'botnet.doc' or
# something.  you need to know what you're doing.

# if you want to use a different nickname on the botnet than you use on
# IRC, set it here:
#set botnet-nick "LlamaBot"

# what telnet port should this bot answer?
# NOTE: if you are running more than one bot on the same machine, you will
#   want to space the telnet ports at LEAST 5 apart... 10 is even better
# if you would rather have one port for the botnet, and one for normal
#   users, you will want something like this instead:
#listen 3333 bots
#listen 4444 users
# NOTE: there are more options listed for the listen command in
#   doc/tcl-commands.doc
listen 3333 all

# [0/1] This setting will drop telnet connections not matching a known host
# It greatly improves protection from IRCOPs, but makes it impossible
# for NOIRC bots to add hosts or have NEW as a valid login
set protect-telnet 0

# [0/1] This setting will make the bot ignore DCC chat requests which appear to
# have bogus information on the grounds that the user may have been trying
# to make the bot connect to somewhere that will get it into trouble, or
# that the user has a broken client (like mIRC tends to do), in which case
# the connect wouldn't work anyway.  It's suggested that you turn this on.
set dcc-sanitycheck 1

# and a timeout value for ident lookups would help (seconds)
set ident-timeout 5

# [0/1] users with the +o (global or channel op) flag will still need the +p
# (party line) flag to join the dcc chat party line?
set require-p 0

# [0/1] allow people to telnet in, type 'NEW', and become a new user?
# (If you set this to 1, you must set protect-telnet 0)
set open-telnets 0

# [0/1] Display 'Nickname.' instead of identifying ourselves when people
# telnet in. Set to 1 to only display Nickname.
# (useful if someone portscans your machine, they wont know we're here)
set stealth-telnets 1

# [0/1] Display a banner when people telnet in.
set use-telnet-banner 1

# How long (in seconds) should I wait for a connect (dcc chat, telnet,
# relay, etc) before it times out?
set connect-timeout 15

# number of messages / lines from a user on the partyline (dcc, telnet)  before
# they are considered to be flooding (and therefore get booted)
set dcc-flood-thr 3

# how many telnet connection attempt in how many seconds from the same
# host constitutes a flood?
set telnet-flood 5:60

# [0/1] apply telnet flood protection for everyone?
# set this to 0 if you want to exempt +f users from telnet flood protection
set paranoid-telnet-flood 1

# how long should I wait (seconds) before giving up on hostname/address
# lookup? (you might want to increase this if you are on a slow network).
set resolve-timeout 15


##### MORE ADVANCED STUFF #####

# temporary ignores will last how many minutes?
set ignore-time 15

# this setting affects what part of the hour the 'hourly' calls occur
# on the bot, this includes such things as note notifying,
# You can change that here (for example, "15" means to
# notify every hour at 15 minutes past the hour)
# this now includes when the bot will save its userfile
set hourly-updates 00

# if compiled with owner, the following user(s) will ALWAYS have the
# owner (+n) flag (You really should change this default)
set owner "rolle"

# who should I send a note to when I learn new users?
set notify-newusers "$owner"

# what flags should new users get as a default?
# check '.help whois' on the partyline (dcc chat, telnet) for tons of
# options.
set default-flags "hp"

# [0/1/2] allow people from other bots (in your bot-net) to boot people off
# your bot's party line?
# values:
#   0 - allow *no* outside boots
#   1 - allow boots from sharebots
#   2 - allow any boots
set remote-boots 2

# [0/1] if you don't want people to unlink your share bots from remote bots
# set this to 0
set share-unlinks 1

# to enable the 'tcl' and 'set' command (let owners directly execute
# Tcl commands)? - a security risk!!
# If you select your owners wisely, you should be okay enabling these.
# to enable, comment these two lines out
# (In previous versions, this was enabled by default in eggdrop.h)
unbind dcc n tcl *dcc:tcl
unbind dcc n set *dcc:set

# [0/1/2] only let permanent owners use .tcl/.set if bound? then set it to 1
# moreover only let permanent owners use .dump? then set it to 2
# (the people must set the $owner variable)
set must-be-owner 1

# maximum number of dcc connections you will allow - you can increase this
# later, but never decrease it, 50 seems to be enough for everybody
set max-dcc 50

# this setting is so that people can't send fake ports to your bot when
# they try to dcc it. irc clients should never use a port below 1024 and
# well 65535 is the highest port possible. this setting is used for telnet
# too.
set dcc-portrange 1024:65535

# If a bot connects which already seems to be connected, I wait
# dupwait-timeout seconds before I check again and then finally reject
# the bot. This is useful to stop hubs from rejecting bots that actually
# have already disconnected from another hub, but the disconnect information
# has not yet spread over the botnet due to lag.
set dupwait-timeout 5



########## MODULES ##########

# below are various settings for the modules available with eggdrop,
# PLEASE EDIT THEM CAREFULLY, READ THEM, even if you're an old hand
# at eggdrop, lots of things have changed slightly

# this is the directory to look for the modules in, if you run the
# bot in the compilation directories you will want to set this to ""
# if you use 'make install' (like all good kiddies do ;) this is a fine
# default, otherwise, use your head :)
set mod-path "modules/"


#### DNS MODULE #####

# this module provides asynchronous dns support. This will avoid long
# periods where the bot just hangs there, waiting for a hostname to
# resolve, which often let it timeout on all other connections.
loadmodule dns

##### CHANNELS MODULE #####

# this next module provides channel related support for the bot, without
# it, it will just sit on irc, it can respond to msg & ctcp commands, but
# that's all
loadmodule channels

# the chanfile: where dynamic channel settings are stored
set chanfile "QuizBot.chan"

# temporary bans will last how many minutes? if set to 0, bot never removes
# them.
set ban-time 120

# temporary exemptions (+e modes) will last how many minutes? if set to 0,
# bot never removes them. This is an IRCNET feature. The bot will check the
# exempts every X minutes, but will not remove the exempt if a ban is set on
# the channel that matches that exempt. Once the ban is removed then the
# exempt will be removed the next time the bot checks.
set exempt-time 60

# temporary invitations (+I modes) will last how many minutes? if set to
# 0, bot never removes them. This is an IRCNET feature. The bot will check the
# invites every X minutes, but will not remove them if the channel is +i. Once
# the channel is -i then the bot will remove then invite mode next time it
# checks this counter
set invite-time 60

# [0/1] expire bans/exempts/invites set by other opped bots on the channel?
# set force-expire 0

# [0/1] share user greets with other bots on the channel if sharing user data?
set share-greet 0

# [0/1] allow users to store an info line?
set use-info 1

# these settings are used as default values when you
# .+chan #chan or .tcl channel add #chan
# look in the section above for explanation on every option

#   not specifying or using number = 0 will not check de-op floods!
# flood-kick (number:seconds)
#   how many kicks in how many seconds is a mass kick?
#   not specifying or using number = 0 will not check mass kicks!
# flood-join (number:seconds)
#   how many joins/nick changes in how many seconds is a join flood?

# note that "need-op", "need-invite", etc, are limited to 120 characters,
# so if you want to so something more complicated, just write a proc,
# and make them call your proc.

# there are also a lot of options that can be turned on or off for each
# channel.  to turn an option on, put a + in front of it.  to turn it off,
# put a - in front of it.  i.e., to have auto-op, put:
#   +autoop
# to turn it off, put:
#   -autoop

#   when a ban is set, kick people who are on the channel and match the
#   new ban?  (i.e., they were on the channel before the ban)
#channel set #lamest +enforcebans

#   Only activate bans on the channel when necessary?  (This keeps the

#channel set #lamest +statuslog

#   remember people who deop/kick/ban bots, valid ops or friends, and punish them?
#   users with +f (friend) flag are exempt from revenge
#channel set #lamest +revenge

#   this works similar to revenge, but it triggers only for valid bots and
#   allows the deop or kick of an op
#channel set #lamest +revengebot

#   voice users with +v (voice) flag when they join the channel?
#channel set #lamest +autovoice

#   prevent this channel from being listed on the botnet?  (for paranoid

#   do you want the bot not to be able to kick +o flag users ?
#   letting them kick-flood for instance, to protect the channel against
#   clone attacks
#channel set #lamest +dontkickops

#   prevents the bot from joining the channel (or makes it leave the channel
#   if it is already there).
#   Can be useful to make the bot leave a channel without loosing it's
#   settings (flood settings, all these "channel set" settings), user flags
#   for this channel, bans for this channel, and without affecting any
#   sharing
#channel set #lamest -inactive

# [0/1] define this if you want to bounce all server invitations (+I modes)
#  * This is an IRCNET feature
set bounce-invites 0

# If there are more than max-exempts active +e modes on a channel, then

# server. Only 2.10 servers are concerned by these +e modes.
#  * This is an IRCNET feature
set max-exempts 20

# If there are more than max-invites active +I modes on a channel, then

#  * This is an IRCNET feature
set max-invites 20

# The following lines should be left uncommented unless the default values
# are being over-ridden. By default exempts and invites are on for IRCnet
# and hybrid EFnet, but off for all other networks. This behavior can be

# modes then you'll be unable to use these features.
#
# [0/1] Do you want to enable exempts?
# set use-exempts 0

# [0/1] Do you want to use invites?

# [0/1] Prevent mixing normal modes and +I/+e invite modes?
# At the moment (Sep/1999), IRCnet servers do not allow mixing those modes,
# so leave this flag set to 1. The servers will probably change their
# behavior in the future, so you should first check before accepting the
# default.
