If you have an older installation of eggdrop, here are some notes on
how to upgrade.

anything to 0.8.0
-----------------

  0.8.0 requires eggdrop 1.6.8 together with a TCL 8.x installation.
  Make sure you have it, else MoxQuizz probably won't work. 

  Upgrading is easy: You just have to move some files and make minor
  adjustments to your moxquizz.rc.  Existing eggdrop configurations
  can safely be reused.

  . REQUIRED: Unpack the new version in parallel to your current
    installation.

  . OPTIONAL: If you changed channelrules.txt or channeltips.txt, move
    them to the corresponding moxquizz-0.8.0/intl/<language>
    directory.

  . OPTIONAL: If you made any changes to the script setting (like
    quizchannel and stuff), manually transfer them from your
    moxquizz.rc to the new one (though it is safe to simply copy the
    old over the new.  The script will add the new keywords
    automagically [though without nice comments]).

  . REQUIRED and IMPORTANT: Copy quizdata/rankallstars.data to the new
    installation.

  . OPTIONAL: Copy quizdata/comments.txt and
    quizdata/questions.users.new, if you have them.

  . REQUIRED: Rename the new directory to moxquizz (or make a link)
    and restart your bot, using your existing eggdrop configuration.
    Thats it.

  . VOLUNTARY: If you happen to speak a language besides english, feel
    free to create a translation, see README.translation for some info
    how to do this.
