               - 0.8.x version are dedicated to Lefty -

Version 0.8.1 (2003-07-20)
--------------------------

  - NEW: moxtools: added code to enable users with flag Q to use a
         .!jump command similiar to the .jump for bot masters
  - NEW: added three new question files with english questions (+788
         questions)
  - NEW: added option to prevent overruns (expert players entering a
         game at a late state and overrun the others to gain a high
         allstars score).  When enabled, MoxQuizz does not accept new
         players as soon as one player reached a certain threshold in
         point (defaults to 15 points)
  - NEW: added !antispam command to moxtools.  Sends a antispam.txt
         file (if available and enabled) from the intl dir.
  - NEW: public commands for quizmasters (flag P): !nuq, !uq, !listnuq
         for placing users in ignore for userquestsions (for 45 minutes) 
  - NEW: added .!identify to moxtools.tcl to manually force the script
         to identify to a nickserv (flag P)
  - NEW: added another 185 german questions (thanks to "Said Nasser"
         <viper5539@web.de> and his users)
  - NEW: MoxQuizz will purr if it gets patted (sometimes)

  - FIX: dcc "!say !hug FOO" works again

  - CHG: randomization of questions changed: same algorithm, just
         distributed over the time, i.e. randomization is done bit
         by bit whenever a question is asked.  This speeds up all
         operations which caused a read of the database (.!rehash,
         .reload and initial start of the bot)
  - CHG: renamed !saveuserquestions to !qsave
  - CHG: renamed !configload to !load
  - CHG: renamed !configsave to !save

--------------------------

  - NEW: the script is now able to speak several languages.  Added
         english phrases and such. Funstuff is still english only.  As
         a consequence, MoxQuizz now requires eggdrop version 1.6.6
         and TCL 8.1

         english, german: Moxon <moxon@meta-x.de>
         french: "Gun@gnoo.org" <Gunslinger@ifrance.com>
         greek:  George (bibib)

  - NEW: funcmd !fast (suggestion from ILoveJackDaniels)
  - NEW: funcmd !cry (suggestion from ILoveJackDaniels)
  - NEW: option to define default aftergameaction (former always
         newgame), check moxquizz.rc for aftergameaction (suggested by

  - NEW: norwegian question sets (566 question, thanks to Julia33 and
