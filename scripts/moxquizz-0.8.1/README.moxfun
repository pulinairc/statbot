0. Introduction
---------------

All the funny commands like !bow and !roll have been extracted from
MoxQuizz into this standalone package.  This file describes all known
commands and configuration.  Mere mortals just need to read section 1
and 4, whilst immortal eggdrop masters are interested in section 2
and 3, too.

You're a mortal?  Skip to section 4.



2. Commands to control the funstuff
-----------------------------------

Well, though you are immortal, read carefully.  The bot is controlled
by sending commands via /msg and dcc.  All fun control commands can be
invoked by users known to the bot as quizmaster (flag P).  Note that
all commands must be invoked over a dcc chat session like this: .!tip
or . !tip The "!" is there because of historical reasons and to avoid
clashes with other dcc commands.

  P   !roll (on|off) - switch !roll on or off
  P   !fun (on|off)  - switch all fun commands on or off (including roll)




3. Installation/Configuration
-----------------------------

Installation is quite easy, just source the moxfun.tcl from your
favorite eggdrop.conf.

If you wear hard hats, then you can play around with some
configuration variables:

   funstuff_enabled 1      include the funstuff.  This can be changed
                           by !fun (on|off).
   roll_allowed 1          allow !roll.  This can be affected by
                           !roll (on|off)

If you want to change places, adjust the following:

   datadir        moxquizz/quizdata

   harteierfile   $datadir/harteier.txt
   weicheierfile  $datadir/weicheier.txt
   phrasefile     $datadir/phrases.txt
