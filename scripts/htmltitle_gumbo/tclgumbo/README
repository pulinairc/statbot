===== Gumbo =====

Gumbo is an implementation of the [HTML5 parsing algorithm] implemented
as a pure C99 library with no outside dependencies.  It's designed to serve
as a building block for other tools and libraries such as linters,
validators, templating languages, and refactoring and analysis tools.

Goals & features:

* Fully conformant with the [HTML5 spec].
* Robust and resilient to bad input.
* Simple API that can be easily wrapped by other languages.
* Support for source locations and pointers back to the original text.
* Relatively lightweight, with no outside dependencies.
* Passes all [html5lib-0.95 tests].
* Tested on over 2.5 billion pages from Google's index.
